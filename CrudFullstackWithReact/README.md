# CRUD Operation
Here, I have created a Employee Portal where we can add,delete,get,update employees in the database with the help of react.
This is a fullstack application where we can do crud from the frontend.
The Tech stack used is Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, MySQL, React, Bootstrap and axios.
